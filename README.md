# Linkeded ⚡️

Welcome to **Linkeded** — a collection of the code I share on LinkedIn. Think of this as the behind-the-scenes vault for my posts, where you can grab the source, tweak it, and make it your own.

## What’s in here?

Whenever I post code snippets, tutorials, or solutions on LinkedIn, you'll find the full source code in this repo. From Python scripts to Java algorithms, everything lives here. No fluff, just code.

## How to use:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gomji-1/Linkeded.git
